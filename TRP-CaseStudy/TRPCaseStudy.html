As the whole process is manual and on paper, it can lead to several miscalculations for which a candidate or the government is equally liable.

With the wrong measures in evaluating capable candidates, there's hope, commitment, and endeavor that have been compromised leaving them dispirited. This results in utter chaos as we go deep into it.

                            <p> Pre-Examination: </p>
                            <p>Our primary approach to the problem of improper filling of candidate forms is to accumulate Data mining. Data mining is generally a process of sorting through large data sets. This is used to extract information to identify patterns, trends, and useful data for simple analysis. We perform a lot of data mining in this case, to simply term, better than many others. Primarily used to breach the collected data, which means removing unwanted patterns, and attributes and editing it appropriately. Machine learning algorithms have been implemented and used to simplify the datasets as required. We extract a huge database consisting of candidate personal details that are needed to register, and load possible wrong inputs to compare the entered details. This whole process is done to analyze the data so that the wrongly entered can be removed and the fine data into that space. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The process of analysis in general is fractionally based on the Date of birth of the candidate. The entered date of birth is rechecked for a candidate to meet the age constraints. If any candidate does not satisfy the applied conditions, he/she is disregarded to proceed with the examination.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finding the junk is the initial step in data mining. A lot of algorithms are implemented to find and replace the junk. 

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The process of center scheduling is done similarly to the existing methods. We ensure no two candidates from the same address are sitting next to each other. Randomization techniques are implemented here to carry this out. A matrix of 24 is considered with candidate addresses as attributes and is randomized as appropriate to meet the constraints.  
                            </p>
                            <p>Examination:</p>
                            <p>
                                The examination for recruitment is conducted through a Computer Based test. Each question is properly jumbled so that every two candidates have the same question with a different serial number, completely avoiding the scope of duplication. We capture biometrics and photographs of the candidate during the exam to ensure that the same person who registered is attending the exam. As soon as the exam ends, candidate responses are uploaded to the cloud which can be downloaded by them right away. 

                            </p>
                            <p>Post-Examination:</p>
                            <p>The correct solutions of the test are uploaded onto the cloud after the examination so that candidates can certainly evaluate their papers. This promotes transparency which consecutively is beneficial both for the government and the candidate. </p>
                            <p>
                                Payment gateway integrations are actively performed. Each candidate is given an option to register and pay for a specific post. The payment is carried out with validation through OTP sent to the candidate. Once the payment is successful, the candidate is notified immediately. All the operations are carried out on our easy-to-use payment gateway software, which supports debit and credit card transactions. 
                            </p>
                            <p>An Admin dashboard is provided by us where the government officials can track the live information about statistics of applications, Candidate registrations, and payment reconciliations along with alerts for complications. </p>
                            <p>
                                Marking us unique:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The moment a candidate uploads a photograph during the examination, our ultra-modern software determines the quality of the photo. It can also tell if the person in it is a male or a female. This implementation is a lot more convenient and simpler, making it absolutely productive, and can also be used to conduct validation in a very short time than done manually. We kindly ask the candidate to upload again in case of improper entry. All of this is carried out right on the spot. 
                            </p>
                            <p>WHY</p>
                            <p>Why that solution:</p>
                            <p>
                                We incorporated Data mining to carry out data evaluation of the candidate details effortlessly. As the recruitment process obtains numerous applications, this method makes it easier to arrange and identify faulty variables giving the scope to validate at an early stage. <br>
To optimize the process of center scheduling, Randomization techniques are implemented to assign the examination locations. Random allocation is done to prevent candidates coming from the same location are seated in the same proximity. <br>
Biometric and facial recognition in examinations are employed to prevent the case of impersonation. The candidate's biometrics and photographs are collected before the exam, during the exam, and after the exam to make the process wholly transparent. As the number of candidates is huge for one examination, these techniques make it easy to record attendance. <br>
Determining the gender from a poor-quality picture is a great breakthrough for the recruitment process as it can rationally streamline digital authentication. Our unique identification AI software is used to maximize the quality of the uploaded picture, reduce unwanted pixels, and deliver the picture with optimum quality. <br>
All the above-mentioned solutions are made sure to be optimized in terms of time, energy, and costs.

                                The Ultimate goal is to make the whole process of recruitment transparent. This makes government recruitment explicit, and no false allegations are raised due to the lack of appropriate data. </p>
                            <p>With our implementations, Data entry and Payment integrations are spontaneous. Data analysis is prominently done to identify if the registered candidate is the same as the one who attempts and submits the exam. So, this approach is as such we verify the candidates all through the course of the exam.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The candidates can thoroughly evaluate the answer sheets so there will be no illegitimate queries based on the results. This makes the entire recruitment process beneficial to the Government.
