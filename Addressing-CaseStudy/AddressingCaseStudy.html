With deep learning algorithms, we can determine even the minor differences from the original copy. Applied Pytesseract to recognize characters in the signature and match it with the registered signature.</p>

                                <p>The algorithms in play are capable of identifying multiple false signatures at once which simplifies verification. We load the trained signature model into the system and make use of the PyTesseract tool for detecting number configuration from an image. The signature from the cropped image is further cropped and saved individually by the reg no. of each candidate.</p>

                                <p>With Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the signature data, we train the signature classification model. This process has an accuracy rate of 90% and has a significant potential for upgrading attendance checks in examinations.</p>

                            It has been approved that RFID can add value and visibility to racing events of all types.
                            One of the long-established applications of RFID has been marathon racing. The tracking
