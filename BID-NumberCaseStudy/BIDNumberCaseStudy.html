                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <div class="img-content-casestudy">
                        <img src="../images/caseStudy/one.png" alt="" class="caseStudyImage">

                            <p>Solution:</p>
                            <p>We introduced a system that functions with AI and performs Bib detection and recognition on each candidate’s linked Bib number. Our process includes capturing shots at the training scene and recognizing Bib placed around the candidates’ chest. Firstly, the detection process is carried out by identifying the Bib number and confirming whether the number tag is worn by the same individual throughout the test.</p>
                            <p>Then the recognition process is carried out by determining whether the assigned Bib number is worn by that registered individual by referring to our previously collected candidate registration database.</p>

                            <p>Functions:</p>
                            <p>Dataset collection:</p>
                            <p>A set of candidate videos from the PET event are collected and converted into images. The videos must be crystal-clear to detect the numbers easily.</p>
                            <p>Data Annotation:</p>
                            <p>We deployed the LabelImg tool to label the necessary objects while training the system.</p>
                            <p>In this case, we first annotate the person from the image and then the Bib number attached to them.</p>
                            <p>The annotated objects are stored in an XML file and are reinspected with Python script.</p>
                            <p>Data splitting:</p>
                            <p>The annotated data is further split into train, validation, and test data in required percentages. This data is converted and stored in TensorFlow records, consuming less space to store and transfer suitable quantities of data.</p>
                            <p>Data training:</p>
                            <p>We train the model for object detection with TensorFlow 2. Applied SSD MobileNet v2 model supporting high performance and speed. The evaluation can be accessed during the training to view the process.</p>
                            <p>Monitoring the progress with TensorBoard:</p>
                            <p>Through TensorBoard, a feature named TensorFlow is used such that it helps us monitor the training task with ease. Once minimal to no loss is reported after we examine the training loss, validation loss, and accuracy, we export the model and test the test data.</p>
                            <p>Data Testing:</p>
                            <p>Testing is performed on the exported model to produce the final product.</p>
                            <p>Why TensorFlow? (optional)</p>
                            <p>TensorFlow provides us with the scope of flexibility at a satisfactory speed. Designed to make prototyping and debugging easier. Gives multi-layered abstraction arrangements allowing us to choose the right one based on our requirements.</p>

These tags can store data relating to the specific runner to whom they are attached, and rewrite again without any necessity for contact or line of sight. Data within a tag can provide identification for a person, their details, and other customized information. The chip also has a “multi-read” function, which means that several tags can be read at once.</p>
                            <p>It now has become convenient to record the best time with our complete range of UHF RFID race timing tags, suitable for multisport events such as marathons, biathlons, triathlons, cycle races,  swim races, motorsports, etc. </p>

                                It has been approved that RFID can add value and visibility to racing events of all types.
                                One of the long-established applications of RFID has been marathon racing. The tracking

                            It has been approved that RFID can add value and visibility to racing events of all types.
                            One of the long-established applications of RFID has been marathon racing. The tracking
